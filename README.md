This portfolio was inspired by [Noel Berry's portfolio](http://noelfb.com/) and made using the tools provided by Github pages like Jekyll and such.
I also used Masonry js to arrange my projects in a grid. As Noel's portfolio source code is public I learned a lot reading it and wanted to make my own portfolio source code public too.
