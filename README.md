This is the code of my portfolio at https://arunakemi.github.io/ , I'm using Github pages to host it.

The portfolio was built using Typescript running on NodeJS, what you see here is the build output. The main libraries I used are [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/) for canvas graphics, [MatterJS](https://brm.io/matter-js/) for physics, and [AnimeJS](https://animejs.com/) for animations.
